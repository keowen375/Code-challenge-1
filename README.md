# 3Data Structures and algorythms.

# Question One
# Function Check if Balanced
This function takes a string containing parentheses, curly braces, and square brackets, and determines whether 
the expression is balanced

sample input = 
- expression1 = "([]{})"
- expression2 = "([)]"
- print(is_balanced(expression1))  # Output: True
- print(is_balanced(expression2))  # Output: False


# Question Two
## Function to Remove Duplicates from a Sequence
This function takes in a sequence and returns a new list without duplicate values while maintaining the original order of elements.

sample input = 

- input_sequence = [2, 3, 2, 4, 5, 3, 6, 7, 5]
- result = remove_duplicates(input_sequence)
- print(result)  # Output: [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]

Question Three
function word_frequency(sentence) takes a sentence and returns a dictionary containing the frequency of each 
word in the sentence. 

sample input = 

- sentence = "This is a test sentence. This sentence is a test."
- result = word_frequency(sentence)
- print(result)
